## Technologies:
Tamarjy is a machine-learning-based web application built with Python and using the following technologies:

* **spacy**: used for building the custom Name Entity Recognition (NER) model that is responsible for identifying the symptoms in the user input text.
* **sklearn**: used for training the disease prediction model, and the dataset used for the training was collected from *[kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marslinoedward/disease-prediction-data)*. *NumPy* and *Pandas* are also used for the prediction model training.
* **Flask**: used for building web application codebase
* **MYSQL**: database system, and *sqlalchemy* had been used as the ORM on the application codebase.
* **Tailwind, and JQuery**: both had been used on the front end, as CSS framwork and for the DOM manipulation and Dynamic content creations respectfully.

> **All the Technologies used in Tamarjy have been selected to serve a specific purpose:<br> <span style='font-weight:400'>Optimizing Tamarjy's speed with a reduced content size to ensure seamless accessibility in low-connectivity regions.<span>**
